# Homework: Understanding Frameworks

I realize that you need to spend time working on your CMS project this week, but please go as far as you can to complete a project tutorial in the lesson module for either the Zend or Symfony framework. These are the two big players in the industry, and both have similar installation and development requirements.  The installation can be a bit tricky, so be sure to post questions to the discussion forum if you have problems. Once it is installed and you have started to follow the steps to generate MVC components, you'll begin to appreciate how much work the framework can save you and how much you would need to learn to master the framework tools.

After you select and work with the framework, submit a Microsoft Word document in this assignment that describes the framework you selected and answers the questions below.

- How does the framework work?
- Does using a framework make sense all the time? Why? Why not?

# Project: Adding a User and Logging Out

Develop PHP scripts and pages that will allow an admin to add new users to the system.  If appropriate, give certain users administrative privileges and other users standard privileges.  Also, make sure to have the functionality to have both administrators and standard users to log out of their accounts.

If you expand the feature to include CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) scripts so the admin can have the ability to list the users in the system, modify their credentials, and remove them from the database, you'll earn an extra two points to your grade for this week's project assignment.

After completing your project for this week, zip up your entire project and submit in this assignment.
